Swalk - Find a Date Today!

Swalk is an online matchmaking system,to support connecting users. The system will provide users with a responsive (web design approach that aims to make an application work suitably across platforms) front-end to register, search and match them appropriately using matching algorithms. In this context responsive is referring to the design principles associated with building a front end that will work suitably across platforms and maintaining accessibility for users. With the functional requirement of registering and logging in users, a database will be incorporated to keep this information, and an administrator account type will be designed to ensure back-end processes can be managed, for example filtering out spam accounts.

Built with Wordpress and SQL Database. Hosted on Google Cloud Micro Virtual Machine.
